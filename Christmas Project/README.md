\fs43\fsmilli21600 \cf2 ###
\b \cf4 By having different level of reading speed, the program allows people can find their reading capacity and, by continuously challenging the higher level of reading speed, people will achieve their goal step by step. During the training, the program will print different texts for different practice. The difficulties of the different reading is approximately similar. As a result, the only variable in different stage is only the number of the words. In the program, we set 5 levels, listed below.
